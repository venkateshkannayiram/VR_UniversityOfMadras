virtual reality (VR), is the use of computer modeling and simulation that enables 
a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3D) visual or other sensory environments. 
VR applications immerse the user in a computer-generated environment that simulates reality through 
the use of interactive devices, which send and receive information and are worn as goggles, headsets, gloves, or body suits.
